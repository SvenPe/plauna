  "One-shot data migration from a SQLite file to a configured MariaDB database.
   Reads from SQLite directly (regardless of the current active datasource), runs
   Flyway on the target MariaDB to create the schema, then copies every table in
   FK-safe order using ON DUPLICATE KEY UPDATE col = col so partial re-runs are idempotent.
   Rows are streamed from SQLite and inserted in chunks: a whole table (the bodies of every
   e-mail!) is never held in memory, and one statement carries many rows instead of one."
