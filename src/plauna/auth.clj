  "Web UI authentication: password protection plus optional mTLS authentication through a trusted
   reverse proxy.

   The active password is established at startup by initialize! with the precedence:
   PLAUNA_PASSWORD environment variable > previously stored password > a freshly generated one
   (printed to the log once). The hash is persisted in the preferences table and cached in memory.

   mTLS authentication can be configured in the administration UI or through environment variables.
   NGINX must verify the client certificate and forward its escaped PEM value. A separate shared
   secret authenticates NGINX to Plauna so clients cannot gain access by forging the headers."
